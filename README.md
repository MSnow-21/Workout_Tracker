# Project Description

The Work Out Tracker is an application that provides the user the ability to create workouts and also continue past workouts. Each workout is defined as either resistance or cardio with a name for that specific exercise. More exercise features such as the duration, weight, sets, and reps are included with each workout to help the user track progress. Along with an initial seed.js to add exercises to the program, the application is modeled to take in this specific information into a Mongoose Schema and add that information to MongoDB database. Because of the database capabilities, the user can find past workouts and also create workouts. This is completed using GET, POST, and PUT request in express js.
